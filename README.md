Overview
This code is a simple demonstration of my familiarity with the C++ programming language, including syntax, threading, mutex usage, and basic operations with data structures. It is not intended for any practical use such as stock trading, financial modeling, or performance optimization. Instead, it serves solely as an educational example showcasing my ability to:

Use multithreading to simulate concurrent operations.
Manage shared resources safely using mutex locks.
Work with C++ STL components like vectors and threads.
Implement basic structured programming techniques.

Description
The program simulates a simplistic stock trading scenario. It uses:
A StockData struct to store properties of a stock.
A vector of StockData objects as a small dataset.
Threads to concurrently handle the buying and selling of stocks.
A mutex (money_mutex) to synchronize access to shared financial data (current_money).
Each stock is either bought or sold based on its should_buy flag, and the program tracks the resulting money balance.

Key Features:
Threading: Demonstrates the use of the std::thread library to perform operations in parallel.
Mutex Locking: Ensures safe access to shared resources using std::mutex and std::lock_guard.
Simple Data Handling: Uses structs and vectors to organize and process data.

Example Output:
The program outputs messages about the buying and selling of stocks and displays the final amount of money after all operations.

Bought stock for 180 dollars
Final money: 100550 dollars
Disclaimer
This code:

Is not optimized for performance or error handling.
Does not reflect real-world stock trading logic.
Was not written for deployment or integration into any systems.
Its sole purpose is to demonstrate proficiency with core C++ features.

How to Run
Compile the code using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++):
c
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 -o stock_trading_simulation stock_trading_simulation.cpp
Execute the compiled binary:
bash
Copy code
./stock_trading_simulation
Dependencies
C++11 or later.
A standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
Conclusion
This code reflects my ability to write clean and functional C++ code, focusing on syntax, data structures, and threading mechanics. It is an academic artifact and should not be interpreted as a real-world application.
